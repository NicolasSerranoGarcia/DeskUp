          ### 🔒 Windows Security Notice

          ⚠️ When running the \`.exe\` for the first time, Windows may display a **"Windows protected your PC"** warning. This is expected and happens because the file is not digitally signed (I don't have the resources to purchase a digital signature ;) )

          This application is safe to use and does **not** contain any malware. The warning appears simply because the executable is new and unsigned.

          #### How to run the application on Windows:

          First, download the zip file and decompress it

          1. After launching the \`.exe\`, if you see the blue "Windows protected your PC" screen:
            - Click on **"More info"**
            - Then click on **"Run anyway"**

          <p align="center">
          <img width="367" height="323" alt="image" src="./assets/windows-security-screen.png" />
          </p>

          2. Make sure all \`.dll\` files remain in the same folder as the \`.exe\`.

          3. You do **not** need to install anything else — all dependencies are included.

          ---

          #### How to run the application on Linux:

          1. Download the `.tgz` package and extract it:

          ```bash
          tar -xzf package-name.tgz
          ```

          2. Navigate into the extracted folder and run the executable:

          ```bash
          cd package-name
          ./appname
          ```

          3. Make sure you have execute permissions; if not, add them with:

          ```bash
          chmod +x appname
          ```

          No additional dependencies are required if using the provided package.
