          ### Windows Security Notice

          When running the `.exe` for the first time, Windows may display a **"Windows protected your PC"** warning. This is expected and happens because the file is not digitally signed (I don't have the resources to purchase a digital signature ;) )

          This application is safe to use and does **not** contain any malware. The warning appears simply because the executable is new and unsigned.

          #### How to run the application on Windows:

          First, download the zip file and decompress it

          1. After launching the `.exe`, if you see the blue "Windows protected your PC" screen:
            - Click on **"More info"**
            - Then click on **"Run anyway"**

          <p align="center">
          <img width="367" height="323" alt="image" src="./assets/windows-security-screen.png" />
          </p>

          2. Make sure all `.dll` files remain in the same folder as the `.exe`.

          3. Search for `DeskUp.exe` and run it!
          
          > Note: You do **not** need to install anything else — all dependencies are included.
