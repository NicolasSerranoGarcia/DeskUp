# Start - Setup tools

[] Add previous documentation of Cmake-test for information about flags

[X] Add support for tests using the CMake-test ones.  

[X] Adapt workflows from CMake-test to work: needs to download wxWidgets

[X] Add support for benchmark using the CMake-test ones

[X] Fix workflows to make them compatible when they run, When run on linux to develop and when run on windows to develop

[X] Pack Linux as an AppImage

[X] Create icon images with distinct sizes

[X] AppImage does not open when double clicking it 

[] (Later in project) Add metadata to Appimage:
    [] The template for the file is already inside appImage.cmake -> sign the appImage, add screenshots...
        https://docs.appimage.org/packaging-guide/optional/signatures.html
        https://www.gnupg.org/gph/es/manual/x154.html
    [] When you enter a stable version (1.x.x) replace the string inside appImage.cmake called PROJECT_VERSION_SHORT inside the xml metadata file

[] (Later in project) Distribute files correctly insdie AppDir:
    [] the structure inside the AppDir should mirror the one on the system, even though the app will go to the system files


[X] add wxwidget libraries automatically to appimage when building

[/] .desktop has lots of functionalities. Look at usr/share/applications/libreoffice-math.desktop

[] Add a dialog that shows up when pressing uninstall on linux. For it, uninstall.sh should call an executable that uses wxWidgets to show a dialogue that asks to uninstall

[] Optional: Add more actions in the linux .desktop for things like Add Workspace or Load Workspace

[] when user installs a copy again, resolve the conflicts with the previous install --IMPORTANT
    - Problems associated with this: Version control for end users: What happens when a user downloads an AppImage that has a newer version than the old one? What happens on the opposite case? Solution may e to create a built-in package manager. Installing and uninstalling already works. The problem comes when user downloads multiple releases or old ones...

    [] for this: create dialogs that pop up when trying to install a release that's already installed. When downloading differing versions:
